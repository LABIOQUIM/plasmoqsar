# QSAR Model

### Setting up
This repository is a Monorepo, meaning all necessary code is here. You'll still need external tools to make it work.  
1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docker.com).
1. You'll also need the [nfsvol plugin](https://github.com/cirocosta/nfsvol) installed.  
1. Then you can copy the file `.env.example` to `.env`. You don't need to change anything at this time.

#### Development
1. On Hold for now.

#### Production
If you want to simply instantiate and use, this is probably what you want.
1. Rewriting...

If everything went okay, you should be able to go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), register a new user and start using the app.
